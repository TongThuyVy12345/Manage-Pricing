# VAT

Original Link: [https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/tax/vat.html](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/tax/vat.html)

Value-added tax (VAT) is a type of indirect tax levied on goods and services for value added at every point of production or distribution cycle, starting from raw materials and going all the way to the final retail purchase.

> State-wise VAT laws: Each state has its own VAT laws for proper implementation and levying. Different states apply different VAT rates according to their implied laws.

| Default Value for Disable Automatic Group Changes Based on VAT ID | VAT ID is an internal identifier for the VAT Number of the customer when used in VAT Validation. During [VAT Validation](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/tax/vat-validation.html), Magento confirms that the number matches the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/vies/#/vat-validation) database. Customers can be automatically assigned to one of the four default customer groups based on the validation results. |

* VAT is not charged if the merchant and customer are located in different EU countries, and both parties are EU-registered business entities.

## Configuring VAT ID Validation

The following instructions include a sample procedure to set up a 20% VAT in the U.K. for sales to retail customers. For other tax rates and countries, follow the general procedure but enter specific information that corresponds to your country, VAT rate, customer types, and so on.

Before proceeding, make sure to find out which rules and regulations apply to VAT in your area.

In certain business-to-business transactions, VAT is not assessed. Magento can validate a customerâ€™s VAT ID to ensure that VAT is assessed (or not assessed) properly. See [VAT ID Validation](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/tax/vat-validation.html).
