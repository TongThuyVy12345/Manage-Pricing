# Tax

## 1. Tax Zones and Rate

Tax rates generally apply to transactions that take place within a specific geographical area. Use the _Tax Zones and Rates_ tool to specify the tax rate for each geographical area from which you collect and remit taxes. Because each tax zone and rate has a unique identifier, you can have multiple tax rates for a given geographic area (such as places that do not tax food or medicine, but do tax other items).

Store tax is calculated based on the storeâ€™s address. The actual customer tax for an order is calculated after the customer completes the order information. Commerce then calculates the tax according to the tax configuration of the store.

5. To apply the tax rate to a range of ZIP or postal codes, do the following:
   *   Select the **Zip/Post is Range** checkbox and define the range by entering the first and last ZIP or postal code for **Range From** and **Range To**.

## 2. Tax Rule

A tax rule is constituted by product class, customer class, and tax rate.&#x20;

Each customer belongs to a specific customer group and is assigned to a customer class. Each product is also assigned to a product class. The default Magento checks the shopping cart of each customer, then calculate the complete tax based on customer class, product class, and the region (shipping address, billing address).&#x20;

It can be said that the tax rule is created after product class, customer class and tax rate settings are completed.&#x20;
